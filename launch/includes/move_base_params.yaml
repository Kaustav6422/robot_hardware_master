# footprint_padding: 0.01 # added
shutdown_costmaps: false
controller_frequency: 5.0 # The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity commands to the base. 
controller_patience: 3.0 # How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a valid control before space-clearing operations are performed

planner_frequency: 1.0 # The rate in Hz at which to run the global planning loop. If the frequency is set to 0.0, the global planner will only run when a new goal is received or the local planner reports that its path is blocked
planner_patience: 5.0 # How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed.

#oscillation_timeout: 10.0 # How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing recovery behaviors. A value of 0.0 corresponds to an infinite timeout
#oscillation_distance: 0.2 # How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be oscillating

# local planner - default is trajectory rollout
base_local_planner: "base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS"
